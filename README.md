# Thor Flash Utility
This is a flash utility for Samsung devices, made from scratch in C#. \
To run this, you must have .NET 8 runtime installed on your computer.

## List of platforms
[+] Linux (USB DevFS method)
[ ] Windows (not implemented)
[ ] Mac OS (not implemented)

## How's it different from Heimdall?
Fun fact: Odin for Linux works exactly using DevFS, and people report it working when Heimdall didn't.
1) Not using a USB transfer library and doing it natively for best results
